- custom  allocator
- clear completely instead of deallocating manually one by one

-stack needs to know size at compile time
-allocating on heap can use number from user for arbitrary

-size of pointer known at compile time

-vector stores in heap
	-holds pointer to beginning
	-holds pointer to end
	-knows amount of elements

-shared ptr when must, like in threads
